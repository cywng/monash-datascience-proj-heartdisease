### Introduction
This is a repo for our group's BCS (Data Science) Final Year project at Monash University. It aims to build a robust machine learning model in order to aid the diagnosis of coronary heart disease through building many strong individual models, and subsequently combining these into many hybrid models. The best performing result will be provided as an API.
